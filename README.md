# About `Pok√©mon Orchid Version` üå∏

**`Pok√©mon Orchid Version`** is a GBA rom hack based off of [RHH's `pokeemerald-expansion`](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion) decompilation project. Set in the brand new region of Tosa, you are a PhD student travelling to the region to conduct research for your thesis on the impact humans have on Pok√©mon migration. Arriving on a boat at Tosa Nature Reserve, your colleague Professor Palm awaits...

# Features üïπÔ∏è

**`Pok√©mon Orchid Version`** features a breadth of quality-of-life improvements found in contemporary Pok√©mon games, as well as a beautiful custom soundtrack. We've taken great care to maintain the feel of the Gen III Pok√©mon experience whilst giving more seasoned players just enough challenge that they can't mash the A button through battles.

*Some highlights include:*
üëãüèª Localised quest-system that encourages exploration and minimises backtracking (looking at you Sinnoh).<br />
ü¶ì A mix of Pok√©mon from generations 1-9, this is NOT a catch-em-all game!<br />
üå¥ The Tosa Region: based on Singapore and Southern Malaysia!<br />
üöß A new approach to gameplay roadblocks: on your journey you will need to capture a specific Pok√©mon to overcome certain obstacles. For example, putting a guard to sleep with a Pok√©mon that can learn Hypnosis...<br />
‚ìÇÔ∏è Wizz around the region with the *Cross-Regional Transport* (CRT): As you progress on your journey, upgrade your Rail Card to unlock new areas of the Tosa Region!<br />

Huge thanks to the ROM Hacking Hideout for the pokeemerald-expansion this was based off of, without you the implementation of many of Pok√©mon Orchid Version's features would be too daunting for me!
