# To-Do

**V0.1**

* Insert new primary tilesets
* Insert player character sprite
* Might be nice to try to have a feature where when you visit a town for the first time, the camera pans around key areas of interest, maybe two or three locations?
* Custom scripts in debug menu
* Fix map design in map preview –> refer to code used in Gen 5 style map banners (these have been toggled in /include/config/overworld.h)
* Intro Sequence
    * Black on-screen, choose your character (male, female, NB)
    * Fade into sat at desk, writing in diary.
    * Announcement of tanoy "We'll shortly be arriving at Tosa Nature Reserve."
    * Character writes in diary, choosing their name. In later versions, would be nice to have this as a graphic O/S similar to how the diploma works?
    * Character can walk about the boat, speaking with other travellers. Speaks with Rival, tanoy announces arrival at Tosa Nature Reserve and requests all passengers disembark.
    * Speak to sailor to disembark, arrives at Tosa Nature Reserve pier (there is also a train station here). Get your passport stamped. You will be asked if you are importing/bringing any Pokémon into the region with you (hinting at how humans have negatively impact Tosa's ecosystem by bringing in a range of non-native Pokémon species).
    * Professor Palm greets you at arrivals.
    * Travel to his field lab, receive note and research drive to deliver to associate in next town over. He notes that you didn't bring an import permit with you, so you'll need these: 1 x PokéPermit, 1 x Starter Pokémon and 1 x Research Drive. He'll signpost you to the next town. No dex or balls yet!
* Timah Town (based on Bukit Timmah)
